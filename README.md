# Kill-all-Monsters-
Simple text based monster fight. Created as an exercise in various programming techniques. Target functionality was outlined, required
functions and classes denoted. Their purpose was dictated. Thier internal structure and and algorythmns were created by me, however and
I took liberties in this version which I work on in my own time. It's mine.
